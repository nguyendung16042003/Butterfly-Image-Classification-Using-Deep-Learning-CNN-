 - Displaying sample images from the dataset.

Randomly selects 9 images using df.sample(9).Loads images from the training directory (train/train).
Resizes images to (224, 224) for consistency.
Normalizes pixel values to the range [0, 1].
Displays a 3x3 grid of images with their respective class labels.

 - Preparing image data for training and validation using ImageDataGenerator.

Splits dataset into 4,100 training images and 900 validation images across 75 classes.

Applies data augmentation (rotation, shifting, zooming, flipping) to improve model generalization.

Rescales images to [0,1] for normalization.

Loads images in batches of 32 with a target size of (224, 224).

 - Running to train the CNN model with early stopping.

Early Stopping:

Monitors val_loss (or val_accuracy).

Stops training if no improvement after 10 epochs.

Restores the best model weights.

Model Training (fit):

Uses train_generator for training data.

Runs for 50 epochs (unless early stopping occurs).

Validates with val_generator.
